# coderDojo
Hi I'm Mike. On regular basis I'm full stack developer, but on weekends I'm volunteer coding tutor in CodeDojo organization.
Yeah, I do it free of charge.

This repo is full of random stuff I share with my pupils. So don't really take it seriously.
Materials, tests, exercises, notes for CoderDojo ninjas.
